					<h2>Bella Hadid</h2> <img src="img/bella1.jpg" alt="" class="fig">
					<p class="desc">Isabella Khair Hadid was born and raised in Los Angeles, California to real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid and former model Yolanda Hadid. Her mother is Dutch, and her father is of Palestinian origin. Hadid has two siblings, an older sister named Gigi, who is also a model, and a younger brother, Anwar. She has two older half-sisters, Marielle and Alana, on her father's side.
         Hadid and her siblings were originally raised on a ranch in Santa Barbara, California for ten years. As a teenager, Hadid was an equestrian and had dreams of attending the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro but had to give up competing in 2013 due to her suffering from chronic Lyme disease. It was not announced that she suffered from chronic Lyme until October 2015. She was diagnosed, along with her mother and brother, with the chronic illness in 2012.
         In fall of 2014, Hadid moved to New York City and began studying photography at the Parsons School of Design, signing to IMG shortly before. She has since dropped out of school due to the success of her modeling career, but has expressed interest in returning to school to take on Fashion Photography as a career once she is done modeling. Hadid has also expressed interest in acting.</p>
