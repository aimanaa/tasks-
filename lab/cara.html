				<h3>Cara Delevingne</h3> <img src="img/cara1.jpg"  alt="" class="fig">
				<p class="desc">Delevingne first began modelling at age ten in an editorial shot by Bruce Weber for Vogue Italia alongside model Lady Eloise Anson.[34] She signed with Storm Model Management in 2009. She worked in the industry for a year before booking a paying job and went through two seasons of castings before landing her first runway show.

Delevingne was propelled to fame after being scouted by Burberry's Christopher Bailey in 2012 while working part-time in the office of a fashion website. Bailey cast her in the company's spring/summer 2011 campaign. Delevingne then commenced the early 2012 season by walking in the Chanel Haute-Couture spring show, at Grand Palais, Paris, on 24 January 2012. The stage was set up to resemble an aeroplane and the clothes the models wore vaguely referenced airline flight attendant uniforms.
The New York Fashion Week was the first of the 'big four' fashion weeks, within which Delevingne walked in nine shows for fashion houses including Jason Wu, Rag & Bone, Thakoon, Donna Karan, Tory Burch, Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera. The week after, London Fashion Week took place. Delevingne exclusively took part in the Burberry Prorsum Womenswear autumn/winter 2012 show, on 20 February 2012. In the front row were celebrities such as Samantha Cameron, Will.i.am, Will Young and her partner in the Burberry campaign, Eddie Redmayne. After her single appearance in London, she took part in six shows in the third of the big four fashion weeks, the Milan Fashion Week.</p>
