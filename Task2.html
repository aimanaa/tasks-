  		23-year-old, Charline Mignot, aka <a href="http://www.pleasemagazine.com/vendredi-sur-mers-interview">Vendredi Sur Mer </a>, is one of the French pop scene’s great new hopes. She almost stumbled into music by coincidence, but, with the release of her first EP Marée Basse in 2017, the singer-songwriter was definitely on to something. We met her over a glass of red wine in a Parisian café.Between Lyon and Paris, I believe you met someone who changed your life? I’ve been living in Paris for three years now. Before that, I was in Lyon, and I lived in London as well. I wrote my first song Est-ce que tu t’en souviens? and posted it on YouTube. That’s how I met my manager. I had been taking photos and showing them. He hounded me for four months for a meeting!
